      <span class="italic font-bold text-[#5e81ac]">Eli</span><span class="italic font-bold text-[#87a2bc]">Projects</span> is a site created in fall 2025 for documenting my building projects to share with friends, family, and acquaintances.
      You'll find write-ups, photos, CAD plans, and the occasional story or anecdote of things I've built.

      Note: this site is for hobby projects done in my spare time related to home improvment, woodworking, electrical, and adjacent "DIY" fields.

              A gym built in the attic of our farm at Tolsti Vrh 47 with an elastic, "bouncy" floor to absorb the impact of weights and plyometric exercises while training, and designed to use the exposed timber framing for mounting exercise equipment.
