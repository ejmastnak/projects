      <p class="mt-3">
        My initial motivation was to simply to install a residual current circuit breaker (RCCB) as a basic safety measure, but the panel had enough questionable traits beyond the lack of an RCCB that I opted for a full replacement—the details are covered in the following text.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-3">
        The end result is far from textbook (in particular it is far more cramped than I would have liked—a consequence of reusing the existing cavity instead of cutting a new, larger cavity into into the masonry wall).
        But, crucially, I ended up with properly balanced circuits, residual current/ground fault protection, and a clear picture of what's going on in the panel.

        <span class="font-bold">Initial status:</span>
        Following the sacred electrician's tradition of talking shit on the existing work (not that I can claim to be an electrician, only a shit-talker), here are some of the, um, questionable characteristics I discovered and replaced in the original panel.
        Some are dangerous, some merely curiosities to chuckle at:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc mt-5 ml-5">
        <li>No cover</li>
        <li>No neutral or ground busbars</li>
        <li>No ground fault protection</li>
        <li>Overly-stripped wire around connectors (read: exposed copper)</li>
        <li>An undersized 10 ampere main breaker</li>
        <li>Overloaded shared neutral wires</li>
        <li>A 3-phase main breaker and supply rail, even though I have one-phase supply</li>
      </ul>

    </SimpleImagePanel>

    <p class="mt-5">Following is a gallery of some of these problems in more detail.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5 text-2xl"> Gallery: Problems with the original panel</h3>

    <div class="mt-6">
      <BentoWrapper>

        <BentoCard classes="lg:col-span-2" title="A renegade three-phase breaker..." imgSrc={threePhaseBreakerImg.src} imgAlt="The three-phase main breaker in the original panel.">
          <p>
            The panel mysteriously used a three phase breaker—note the 400 V rating and three-terminal switching diagram.
            I say mysteriously, because <span class="italic">I have only 1-phase supply!</span> What's going on here? Did I originally have 3-phase power? (This is not unusual in Slovenia like it would be in the USA, even in residential settings.) Who knows...
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">A consequence: the main breaker was rated for 10 amperes (note the C10 marking)—this makes sense with 3-phase input, where the 10 A rating applies to each phase separately. But with my 1-phase input connected to a single terminal only (see the faintly visible thick black wire entering the third-from-left breakers from the top), the end result is a 10 A main breaker, which is <span class="italic">smaller(!)</span> than some of the 16 A breakers used for individual circuits, meaning the main breaker would trip <span class="italic">before</span> any individual circuit breaker, cutting power to the whole apartment if a single circuit overloads.</p>
        </BentoCard>

        <BentoCard classes="lg:col-span-2" title="...made to work with jumper wires..." imgSrc={threePhaseJumpersImg.src} imgAlt="Close-up image of the jumper cables used to connect the three-phase main breaker's terminals.">
          <p>
            Again, my panel had a three-phase main breaker but a one-phase supply.
            To distribute the single-phase supply (black wire entering the breaker on the top left) among the three-phase breaker's (isolated) three terminals, the original installer connected the terminals together with jumper wires (the two short brown wires in the top terminals), making for the funny-looking hack shown above.

          <p class="italic mt-2">By the way, look at that brittle insulation and exposed copper!</p>
          </p>
        </BentoCard>

        <BentoCard classes="sm:hidden lg:block lg:col-span-2" title="...because of needless use of a three-phase rail" imgSrc={threePhaseBusbarImg.src} imgAlt="The removed three-phase rail originally used to distribute power across the breakers of my one-phase panel.">
          <p>
            The panel used a <span class="italic">three-phase</span> supply rail (the piece I am holding in my left hand, with the copper teeth sticking out).
            A three-phase rail like this has three electrically isolated pieces of copper (every third tooth is electrically connected), meant to keep three phases separate. A one-phase rail would have done just fine for my one-phase supply (and been about three times cheaper, <span class="italic">and</span> absolved the need for the hack with the jumper wires, since all the breakers would have been connected by the single piece of copper anyway).
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">Evidence points to my having a three-phase supply at one point, and that whoever did the conversion didn't bother to switch to appropriate one-phase material... or perhaps the original installer just had spare three-phase parts lying around he needed to get rid of? It's a mystery to me!</p>

      The list looked something like this:

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>The goal here was ensure everything went smoothly once I began the rewire (i.e. you don't want to discover halfway through rewiring your panel, with the power cut and the freezer thawing, that you forgot to plan out were an extra cable should go).</p>

    <div class="max-w-2xl">

      <h3 class="mt-5 text-2xl">Planning: Details</h3>

      <p class="mt-3">
        I first mapped out all wires entering the panel to see which circuits they corresponded to, then gave each cable and its constituent wires a label, which I used to keep track of which cable/wire would go where when rewiring.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">I then re-planned circuits to:</p>

      <ul class="my-5 ml-5 list-disc">
        <li>eliminate a few shared neutrals</li>
        <li>balance loads on breakers (e.g. previously the fridge and electric oven were on the same circuit breaker, while a separate circuit elsewhere consisted of only a single rarely-used outlet)</li>
        <li>ensure lights where on different breakers than outlets (standard practice so that if a breaker flips from an overloaded outlet the lights in the room stay on to let you figure out what's going on)</li>
        <li>and (within reason) make breakers near each other in the panel correspond to circuits near each other in the apartment.</li>
      </ul>

      The planning went well; there was no confusion come go-time about which wire went where.

        <summary>
          <span class="font-semibold">Details:</span>
          I'm a helpless nerd, so the planning was done semi-programatically.
          Click to expand if you're curious.
        </summary>

        <p class="mt-4">I first mapped wires to the circuits they should supply, then mapped circuits to the breakers that should control them.
          Note the step of indirection here: I'm first thinking in terms of wires and circuits (when designing circuits in the planning stage), then in terms of circuits and breakers (during the actual boots-on-the-ground work of connecting wires to breakers).</p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          I kept the wires-to-circuits mappings and circuits-to-breakers mappings in separate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 hover:underline">YAML</a> dictionaries and used a Python program to handle the mapping between them progamatically.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-5">The wires-to-circuits mapping looks like this...</p>
        <Code class="my-5 rounded-lg p-4" code={wires2circuits} lang="yaml" />
        <p>...the circuits-to-breakers looks like this...</p>
        <Code class="my-5 rounded-lg p-4" code={circuits2breakers} lang="yaml" />

        The glue between the two files is a just a simple Python script that loads the YAML data into two dictionaries, iterates over the wires and prints the breaker or busbar the wire should connect to.
        Note that the values in the wires-to-circuits dictionary match the keys in the circuits-to-breakers dictionary, which, given a wire in the wires-to-circuits dictionary, allows constant-time lookup of the corresponding breaker. Of course the O(1) lookup time is completely irrelevant in practice for a ~20-entry dataset :)
